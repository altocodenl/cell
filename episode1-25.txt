Hi! Silent episode today as well. I'm on a plane! A lot of travelling, this week.

If you want to know what this is about, please go to https://github.com/altocodenl/cell, or to episode 1.

Last episode we were getting close to the end of splitter. Let's see where we are.

Before we do that, let's take a quick step out and see the roadmap:

- Season 1: get and put (that's it!)
- Season 2: the core language (reference, sequence, conditional).

Alright, let's get season 1 finished!

OK, this test fails, this is the case where there's a non-multiline quote.

Yeah, that logic is completely wrong. I need to slice from the second quote.

It's great to have all the previous tests passing. This is how we can approximate things to a certain level of correctness.

Wow, could we be done with it?

I think that we can move on to the validator now. We might add further test cases to splitter, but for now, all the cases I can think of are covered. Actually, let me give it one more pass, looking at the code.

Yep, we are not properly adding multiple newlines in quoted texts. How could this be?

The corner case for empty lines is covered already.

OK, that return of a value was interpreted as error. Fixed. Now for the other new test case.

I think it's OK to convert foo "bar" into foo bar. Remove the unnecessary quotes.

Looking for our original sequence of work.

Pipeline: splitter -> validation -> sorting -> the actual put
