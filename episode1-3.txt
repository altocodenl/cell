Third episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! Today, I play Kraftwerk but at 0 volume to avoid copyright infringement.

"basic calls" 1 set
              2 get

"after the call" foo bar
"before the call" ""
call "@ set foo bar"

todo 1 "interpret the text that comes in the call"
     2 "update the dataspace within cell"

problems 1 "parse the call" 1 "split the text into words (tokens)"
                            2 "the rest of the parsing"
         2 "define the internal representation of data"

"a call is:" @ destination message
             = response

"assume the call is structured (parsed) as fourdata already"

1 "current call" @ get foo
                 = ""

2 "current call" @ set foo bar
                 = OK

3 "current call" @ get foo
                 = bar
