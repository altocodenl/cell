F1rst post! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. This is the intro episode where I describe the idea. Hope you like The Smiths, otherwise it's going to be a tough watch.

Self-similarity: snowflakes are fractal

Pillar 1: single representation of data
- Text to represent all data
- Four types of data:


1 born 1959
  firstName Gustavo
  lastName Cerati
2 born 1962
  firstName John
  lastName Squire

@ + 1 10
    2 10
= 20

The web browser is our home, our base:
- Portable
- Fast runtime
- Interface maker
- An open standard

github.com/fpereiro/gotob

Relying on:
- Javascript (also gotoB)
- DOM (and the web browser in general)

Requirements for the very first version:
- Textarea
- See data (in fourdata format)
- Read from JSON?
- Output to JSON?
