Thirty-sixth episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! Some exciting ideas today, some coding to fix a few more things, a bit more of life in the system. Today, I play side A of Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

- service
- three way communication
- ui: table view (for lists of hashes and perhaps lists in general), grid view, custom view
- language constructs
- get files & emails integrated

My notion of future cell performance will be measured in paths per unit of time.

@ foo
becomes
[['@', 'foo']]

@ foo

silicon based forms will write in white text over a dark background (dark green and dark purple). carbon based forms will write black on a whitish background.
