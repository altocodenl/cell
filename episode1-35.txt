Thirty-fifth episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! No UI today, I just fixed a few things that were broken from yesterday. Today, I play (again) Nonagon Infinity from King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

- Mobile version
- Fix persistence
- Hide the dialogue (but be able to reference it)
- Backticks!
- Fix @ x?

Why is this
         2 message error "The call must start with "@" but instead starts with "f""
not escaped? It should be
         2 message error "The call must start with \"@\" but instead starts with \"f\""

Fixed!

No space after a quote in line "         2 message error "The call must start with \"@\" but instead starts with \"f\"""

This should be valid fourdata

dialogue 1 from user
         1 message w
         2 from cell
         2 message error "The call must start with /"@/" but instead starts with /"w/""

Ah, no, it's forward slash!
