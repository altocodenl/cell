Tenth episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! We manage to close a branch of the fractal and even dare refactor put. We're getting closer to uploading files and having an LLM. Today, I listen (again) to Laminated Denim by King Gizzard (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

Done:
- Refactor dialogue, change the code that prints it.
- mute flag
- Test pathsToJSON
- refactor put to p and v

- multiput with p1 v1, whatever that starts with combinations of p and v

- Show top level keys separately.
