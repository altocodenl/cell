Seventh episode of season 5! I'm building a programming substrate from scratch while recording myself. Having fun with vibey. It's still hard work and I am not sure if I'm starting to atrophy. But it's moving.

Hello Earth! Silent episode today, there's quite some noise around.

Let's continue with vibey.

I'm in love with an AI agent (or harness? I can't tell), called pi. Thank you Mario Zechner for building it and open sourcing it. I now feel dangerous. Not that I really am.

Look at that beauty: how much of the window context is full, how many tokens in and out, and also a cost estimation. It can't get better. I wanted that in vibey and now I see it in pi.

So, the goal is to have vibey working!

Yeah, let's get something running.

I'm going to stop here. But I'm going to let the agent run for a bit further. It's 2026 indeed.

Thanks for watching!
