Editor, right?

- Edits
- Move around

Edits:
- Add more ground
- Remove ground
- Edit ground

Ground: paths/steps.

Move around:
- Use cursors
- Search (see highlighted results as you type, when entered you can jump between results)
- Expand/contract

A good idea: keep the editor state inside the cell data.

Currently, we have:
- Edits: edit the step you're in (edit ground). No add, no remove.
- Move around: cursors.

Let's add more editing:
- Add ground laterally: type and, when you have a space, create a new step to the right.
- Add ground below: use enter and create a new path with the same prefix as the one you entered on.

TODO:
- Put cursor in dataspace (ignore it when filtering out paths to navigate)
- Implement add ground laterally and below.
- Implement remove
