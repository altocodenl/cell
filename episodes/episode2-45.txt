Forty-fith episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, we finish annotating the new code and actually come up with a good design for "native" calls (for math, comparison and logic).

- Let users overwrite + if they want to.

We need to do three things:
- When you are looking at the first path of a call with multiple paths, get all those values and pass them.
- If you are at the second path or further of a call with multiple paths, don't do anything.
- Make + call the js function.

How to know if you're the first one?
- If it's a list, just check for 1. But no, it could also be 1 foo and 1 bar.
- It could be a hash.

OK, we can do a lookbehind! The paths are sorted. If you don't find an earlier one, go for it. If you do, don't do anything.
