Forty-fourth episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, we keep on annotating the code for `cell.respond`.

A call can be three things:
- A call to a sequence.
- A call to a conditional.
- A call to something that is neither a sequence or a conditional. We call this a reference.

Another way to say this is that a sequence or a conditional are special forms of reference.

Do we support multiple paths in the message in an execution? I don't think so.
