Fourteenth episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! Today I do what I should have done six episodes ago, write a test suite. We "prove" `get` is working. Today, I play Salary Man Simulator from Mitch Murder (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).
