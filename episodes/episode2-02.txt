Second episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, I fall in love with the datagrid, after cheating by working in the train without recording myself. Today, I play some Deadmau5 (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

https://github.com/altocodenl/cell

Goals for cell:
- Paste/upload/email data to a project (formats: JSON, CSV & XLS) and make sense of it with the interface & the LLM. Question: should we be able to edit it and then output it?
- Make an API request and store the result.
- Create a small dashboard that's publicly available through an URL.

@ put 1 "today's cake for 8"
      2 @ "make cake" 8
        : 1 @ mix . @ chocolate @ * . @ people
                                      = 8
                                    . 25
                                = 200
                    = "200 grams of chocolate!"
                  . @ flour @ * . @ people
                                  = 8
                                . 125
                            = 1000
                    = "A kilo of flour!"
                  . @ butter @ * . @ people
                                   = 8
                                 . 75
                             = 600
                    = error "No butter available!"
            = error "An ingredient is missing!"
          2 @ bake degrees 200
                   ingredients @ 1
            = error "No ingredients found"
        = error "No ingredients found"

I'm falling in love with the datagrid, hard.
