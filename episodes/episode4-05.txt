Fifth episode of season 4! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Quick and silent episode, nothing much to see here, moving on.

Hi! Silent episode today. I'm on a train.

Where were we?

Yeah, let's finishing cleaning up the top of the readme.

Whoops, forgot to mute myself.

OK, so now what? Let's tackle the design of cell.respond, with dependencies.

I'm looking up simpler sequences to see how they looked like.

Why are the tests not working in the same way, the old and the new? OK, I was just copying it badly.

We're going to stop here, short episode. Thank you for watching.
