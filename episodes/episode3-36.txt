Thirty-sixth episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. What goes down has to go up at some point. A great work session. We tackle a long standing problem that scared me the last time I was working on it; the test suite advances and, with it, cell as a whole.

A mystery for the next session: how did we just go 5-10x slower when running the test suite? Is it really those regexes?
