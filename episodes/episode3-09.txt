Ninth episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Today, moar editor. After a difficult start, we gain momentum with adding the "dimly" green selection, and we even dare to do the fold/unfold. It's coming together. We need more language.

Tests are an executable assertion of your interfaces. (interfaces in the TODIS sense: https://github.com/altocodenl/TODIS)

The problem:
- I need multi put: I need to edit the cursor and I need to touch the rest of the dataspace.
Since we are at it:
- Edit
- Wipe


put 1 p foo bar
      v result
    2 p editor cursor editing
      v 0

You can still do:

put p foo bar
    v result

As for edit:

Imagine you have

foo bar 1
    joo 2

And you want

"improved foo" bar 1
               joo 2

So you can do
edit p foo
     v "improved foo"

If you want to change foo bar:

edit p foo bar
     v nieuwbar

wipe p foo
(deletes all paths that start with foo)

And: push lepush, pop lepop

TODO:
- Fix issues with fold/unfold (show dots in non cursors that are visible, make sure cursor is not lost)
