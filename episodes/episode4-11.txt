Eleventh episode of season 4! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. I procrastinate and have fun by improving the peformance of sort, and we save about 15-20% on the runtime when running the tests. Not bad.

Hi! Quick silent episode today. We have visitors and there's a lot of background noise.

I was experimenting a bit with performance, because I'm bothered by how slow the test suite is -- well, not the test suite, just cell.

That line at the top of the sorter makes the time go from 950 to 825, a 10-15% reduction.

If I remove the uppercase first thing, let's see: it goes to 780. If I remove the first line of equality,

How can it break?!? Ah, the correctness of when it's the same. So I need that line anyway if I go with that. So, from 950 to 780 to put uppercase before is a great jump: almost 20%. I'll take it.

My rough counter gives me 50ms still spent in sorting.

The validation that goes in the sorter prevents a tie between two paths that have different lengths but have the same prefixer. But that assumes that validation comes before sorting, which is not the case!

This was too short! Let's continue tomorrow. Thanks for watching!
