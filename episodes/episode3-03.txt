Third episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. I'm sneezing a lot. And the navigation came through. I almost feel like playing Nibbles in cell. Very happy. Megadeth helped.

TODO now:
- Fix the second click not making it an input. [DONE]
- Also collect keystrokes outside of inputs so we can move around with the arrows. [DONE]

TODO next:
- Get rid of that expanded or reorganize the cell.
