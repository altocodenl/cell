Third episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, we fix a few bugs that makes the basis quite more resilient. We find a bug in our frontend library. And we chart what's next: a humble JSON/CSV viewer that stores things in individual hashes. Today, I play (again) Tetrachromacy from King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

Humble first use case: put JSON in, make sense of it in the datagrid, be able to see it again.

Text that is breaking our parsing:

dialogue "1" from user
             message "@ foo"
         "2" from cell
             message bar 1 jip
                         2 joo
                     soda wey
foo bar 1 jip
        2 joo
    soda wey
something else


Now, this is also breaking it!

dialogue 1 from user
           message "@ foo"
         2 from cell
           message bar 1 jip
                       2 joo
                   soda wey
foo bar 1 jip
        2 joo
    soda wey
something else

We fixed both issues!
