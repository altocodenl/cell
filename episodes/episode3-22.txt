Twenty-second episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Rewriting tests. Everything expands fractally? It feels like that today.

TODO:
- Finish wipe with cleaning up of empty spaces in lists after wipe
- Port rest of the test suite to 4tx, perhaps add multi put
- Unified cell.call interface on tmp
- Upload
