Fifth episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! I finally get to write some javascript to get things going. Today, I play Deadmau's Random Album Title (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

- Rather than saying "set", I'm going to say "put".

verbs 1 get
      2 put

@ foo
= bar

@ put foo bar
= bar

call 1 "receive message"
     2 "parse it into either a get or put call"
     3 "if the message is not a valid call, return ""ERROR"""
     4 "get localstorage"
     5 "if it's put, update localstorage"
     6 "if it's get, return the value"
     7 "if it's put, return ""OK"""

For now, let's go with single line

"test cases" invalid 1 message whatevs
                       = "Call must start with ""@@"""
                     2 message @get
                       = "Call must start with ""@"" and have a space after it"
                     3 message "@ get " "
                       = "You opened a quote that you forgot to close"
             "valid gets" 1 message @
                          = "the whole thing"
                          2 message @ foo
                          = "get whatever is at foo"
                          3 message "@  foo"
                          = "get whatever is at foo"
             "valid puts" ...

var makeCall = function (message) {
   // @
}
