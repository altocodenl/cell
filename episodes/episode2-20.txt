Twentieth episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, a side quest with file uploads, then we add functionality to hide and show some prefixes. We're getting closer to making cell computable. Today, I listen to Deadmau5 (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

Up next:
- base64 upload of binary
- hide/show more
- client-side quick search at the top

- Count items

@ count depth
        prefix 1 ANZSIC Industry Data 2011
