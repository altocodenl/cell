First episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, we explore drawing the datagrid. We even manage to pull out a nice recursive function in the nick of time. Today, I play Polygondwanaland of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

Wishlist from the previous episode/season:

- service
- three way communication
- ui: table view (for lists of hashes and perhaps lists in general), grid view, custom view
- language constructs
- get files & emails integrated

But, we're going to start with the datagrid
