Fifteen episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, I thought we were out of parsing hell, but forgot of a few details. Are we paying a penance for not using a lexer and a parser? Let's find out! We're almost there, though. Today, I listen to Pappo's Volumen 2 & Volumen 3, plus a bit of The Fixx's Calm Animals (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

ideas for readme (for later):
- talk about time to outcome

This broke us, again.

dialogue 1 from user
           to cell
           = error "The call must start with `@` but instead starts with `/`"
           @ "/ a"
         2 from user
           to cell
           = ok
           @ "@ put p foo
      v /" ///""

What's still broken:
- In textToPaths: the "extra characters" accounted for when measuring matchings of indentations if there's unescaped quotes or slashes.
- In pathsToText: escaping paths back.

Test cases to unescape an element:
- If there's a double quote, add a slash before it!
- If there's any whitespace characters, surround it with double quotes. (We cover this one already)
