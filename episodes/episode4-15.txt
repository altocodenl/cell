Fifteenth episode of season 4! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Almost done rewriting @ put. It looks great.

Hi! Merry xmas! Silent episode today.

We were rewriting cell.put. Trying to resume.

OK, here it goes.

I don't understand where these recursive calls are coming from.

Why don't we reach the exception??

I need to fix the calls to put from cell.call. But still, there's at least one error left inside cell.put.

I need to tough it and go back to the previous invocation, which was generating something weird. Because it shouldn't have mattered.

This is already malformed!

```
p dialog 1 from
           to
```

It should have 1 and 2, not just 1.

The error is in the hooks. I should get the keys. And I should also distinguish text from number there too.

OK, I think we fixed it.

Wow, it worked!!

Whoops...

Don't know why the hide 1 wasn't returned before. I'm going to let that one pass, because it should have been there in the first place.

This is a good change of behavior, so I'll change the test.

It's really working!

I forgot about the dot. I'll add it next time. But fantastic progress! See you next time.
