Thirty-eight episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Today I was naughty and didn't record half an hour of programming. Let's hope this doesn't become a habit. A few more tests, but hairy multiline ones. This is moving forward.

Hello Earth! Silent and short episode today.

I was working in the train and it was a bit weird to record, so I started (gasp) without recording.

I figured out the bug with the multiline texts with empty lines: I was unnecessarily adding spaces to those empty lines.

I also simplified the logic for comparing the expected and the obtained result.

How come it can be an object?! Ah, of course, it can be a hash.

OK, so I was trying to understand the last mystery I have now: in doubly quoted text, why things don't align as I expect them to align.

This is starting to feel sharp.

This is tougher than I thought. It's the double quoting that makes it tricky.

OK, I succeeded, but this is unreadable!

Getting a hand of manually double escaping.

Yeah, that's it.

Let's wrap up here. Thanks for watching!
