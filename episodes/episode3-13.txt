Thirteenth episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Today, we inch forward after taking a couple of detours.

Next:
- Paste some data and don't even hit submit, that already gets it going.
- The upload is like that too: select the file, and as soon as you come back, it's uploading and then done.
- Then we can remove the upload from clipboard, since it's confusing to have two things. Also, we make it more about the textarea.

The detour of the detour:
- Let's make a transactional put file
- Let's figure out how a dialogue entry should be structured
- Let's make an assertion notation (executable) for expressing the structure

What I want to see in the dialogue, each dialogue entry:

= ...
@ ...
diff ??
from @ is oneOf 1 user
                2 LLM
t @ is date
to @ is oneOf 1 cell
              2 LLM

Why do I want to see the diff? To see what changed! Is this the expansion? Or is it something else?

puts don't have expansion. They just add stuff. If our calls are puts, the expansion should be the diff.

We can leave this for later. It doesn't add to the substance. I added time and hide to each element of the dialogue.
