Twenty-ninth episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Redesigning the calls so that we can work close to the database.

Hello! Another non-talkie one today.

If you're just tuning in: https://github.com/altocodenl/cell

Let's keep on having fun with engines. I was actually dreaming with cell and redis yesterday. It's a good feeling. Yesterday's ideas still feel sound today.

I made some dev notes yesterday. I'm thinking on how cell should be modified so that we could just use the DB, rather than the file persistence. Because things would change.

This is taking us deep.
