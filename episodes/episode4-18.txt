Eighteenth episode of season 4! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Don't have the brain to annotate all the code, but thankfully enough brain to get it all working again! Next up is a short polish of wipe and then we're really ready to tackle cell.respond, and, more generally, the remaining parts of fivelogic (or is it sevenlogic?).
