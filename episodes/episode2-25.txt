Twenty-fifth episode of season 2! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out how to make it useful! Today, I start late and just have some fun with tests. We're really ready to tackle walking put.

https://github.com/altocodenl/cell

- call validator from textToPaths, but keep it separate so put can use it. [DONE]

TODO:

- Make put walk up.
- Allow for . in put. Also in get.
- Reference.
   - iterate each path after executing the put.
   - if you find something with an @, take its suffix and run a get on it. all the paths you get, insert them at the prefix of the @ and with a = in the middle.
- Indirect reference. Jump the =s.
- Conditional (if).
- Sequence (do)? Add logic for stop and error.
- List: take a value, make it into a list of paths.
- Count.
