Twenty-seventh episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Subtle bug fixed, all old tests passing again! And I use claude code to write annotated source code and I think it could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

The tests can be the negative of an executable specification.

Our mystery/thriller tonight: how can a test already quite deep into the suite, just getting the entire dataspace, can trigger an error from cell.textToPaths?

       3 c "@ put p foo 2
     @ put v something"

It's almost certainly the abridging before 3! We're not taking THAT into account.
