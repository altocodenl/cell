Eleventh episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Today, we continue where we left off, but first we do some cleaning up. We have a clear path to a demo.

Hi! Today we start in silence, then we'll make this a talkie.

Small todos now:
- fix cursor bug [DONE]
- Interchange fourdata, not json, over the wire [DONE]
- Write server logs into cell so I can inspect them [DONE]

My library doesn't allow plain text! Let's fix that.

Why do we mention www urlencoded in cicek.receive?

OK, I don't have to modify the frontend library. That's a relief.

Will continue later!

OK, we're back.
