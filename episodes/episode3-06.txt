Sixth episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. Lots of ideas of things to implement. Unexpectedly, I end up writing some tests in words, and execute them by hand when running the code. The editor feels a bit like a game; at least there's quite some jumping around. Really keen to see the editor unfold quickly into a useful thing.

At least, let's write the editor tests:
- dataspace is:

foo bar 1 jip
        2 joo
    soda wey
something else

- Noop
   - If the input/textarea on the right is selected, don't do anything on the left.
   - Select a cursor and also check that if the input/textarea on the right is selected, nothing moves.
- Without being in editing mode:
   - Click on a non selected step and see how the cursor jumps there.
   - Go to the left, don't do anything because you're already at position 1.
   - Go all the way to the right, one at a time, until you hit the last one.
   - Be in position 1 of foo bar 1 jip and move down. See it skip to the next distinct position 1 (the something in something else).
   - Do the same going up, it should also jump up.
   - Go back up to an abridged path (like foo bar 2, you'll go to the 2 at position 3). See you can't go left.
- Editing:
   - Click on a selected step and enter edit mode.
   - Change the value.
   - Exit it again with escape, this will not change the value.
   - Enter edit mode again with enter.
   - Change the value again.
   - Exit it again with enter, this will save the change.

TODO:
- Keep on writing the rest of the tests for the cursor and editing.
- Fix them all.
