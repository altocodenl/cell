Twenty-third episode of season 3! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. More tests, decided against multi put. Feeling quite good about the whole thing.

Hello Earth! Silent episode today, then maybe it becomes a talkie.

Where were we?

test.4tx became the most important file of the project.

Mind the indent.

OK, let's test get with context through where we place things!

Olrait, let's do multi put.

Again the tests badly written.

More tests:
- multiput with one key
- multiput with two overlapping keys
- multiput with error
- put with error

Claude got it mostly correct!

Ah, beauty.
