First episode of season 4! I'm building a programming environment from scratch while recording myself. We find a path to a demo. We'll just go at the center of the problem, which is sequence and loop. Make those work well first, and everything else (put, tests, upload) will find their feng shui. We'll rethink the mechanism cell.respond until we understand it perfectly.
