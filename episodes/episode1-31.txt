Thirty-first episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! Today, I can't hide my happiness. It's coming together. We have now a contextual (not lexical) get, and we test it sufficiently. We move onto put and also make it work for some cases already, figuring out what we have left. Today, I play Dare from the Human League, as well as some The Kills (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

get: query path + context path

It's not lexical reference. It is contextual reference. The part of the dataspace from which you are making the call is your context!

dataspace paths
destination + message paths

existing paths + call paths

Remaining work for put:
- Make sure there's a single fork point? No, treat things separately. If you can update multiple parts of the dataspace at once, that'd give you some sort of transaction. Then, iterate through fork points.
- Test multiline stuff just for fun.
