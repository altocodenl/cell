Second episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Today, we have the very Stone Roses playing for us.

- We need to write a parser.

Why?

- JSON -> fourdata
- fourdata -> JSON

Parsing: text -> fourdata (text, number, list, hash)
Serializing: fourdata -> text

Look at a few use cases and induce/generalize from them.

"example 1" fourdata foo bar
            json "{""foo"": ""bar""}"
"example 2" fourdata . 1
                     . 2
                     . 3
            json "[1, 2, 3]"

@ + . 10
    . 10
= 20

No special internal representation, we just use fourdata for everything.

parsing: text -> fourdata
serializing: fourdata -> text
