Thirty-fourth episode! I'm building a programming language/environment from scratch while recording myself. Watch me struggle figuring out the bootstrapping! We do some UI today. It really is coming together, at least for my standards. A few more problems to solve, but we could have something that works on a phone, next session. Today, I play Nonagon Infinity from King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard (at zero volume to avoid copyright infringement...).

We want the cell to contain all of the information of the cell. The dialogue is an integral part of the dataspace. But it's annoying and confusing to show it right there, so we will hide it? Not sure. We are also not letting put be overriden. Perhaps we need to put the user data inside a data hash and show that.
